Welcome to Tom and Dean's Power Tower Defense.

TDPowerTD is a cross-platform Tower Defense game that will run on both PC's and Android devices.

This game comes in the form of 3 Eclipse projects:

TDPowerTD - main code base
TDPowerTD-android - Android game launcher
TDPowerTD-desktop - desktop game launcher

To run the game, you select either TDPowerTD-desktop or the TDPowerTD-android in the Eclipse environment and run it as a Java Application or Android Application respectively.
The main code itself resides in the TDPowerTD folder. This is where the major editing will be done.
Also provided are the data files in the WIP folder.  Feel free to tinker with them to your heart's content.
